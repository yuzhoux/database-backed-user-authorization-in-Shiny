# database-backed-user-authorization-in-Shiny
Shiny Gallery showcases the versatility of Shiny Apps, however the Gallery leads to the use of Shiny Server Pro when it comes to creating a Shiny App that requires a login authorization. Experienced some difficulties to get an inspiring example of Shiny login page code, I am able to successful create my desired login authrozation in Shiny and I want to share this example App with you to help you build your own login page. 
In this example, the correct username and password combination is when username equals to password. To get database-backed login authorization, you just need to uncomment the ch<-odbcConnect("NZSQL",uid=Username,pwd=Password) part (comment out the part corresponding to cases when username equals to password).
